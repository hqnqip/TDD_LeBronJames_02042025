### Assignment Description
The assignment requires me to create a text-based program that uses user-input to make decisions. The current unit is Test Driven Development, which I had to practice by creating separate reference classes in my application and writing unit tests. I also have to implement RegEx patterns.

### Rubric
1 String Variable • 1 String of Numbers • 10 Tests for String • 10 Tests for Number String • 5 Different RegEx Patterns • Client Mock-up • Client Call

### How to Use
Run the program on IntelliJ.
The game is introduced. You are asked to type a username; otherwise, you are registered as a guest.
Then, the program introduces your rival, someone to play against you. 

Both you and your rival begin on Position 1. 
Answer the prompt or question assigned to that position.
Answer correctly, you have a chance to make the basketball hoop and advance.
Answer incorrectly, you automatically return to Position 1.

The goal is for you to make your way to Position 7, OR be the first person to earn 30 points by making in hoops.
Each position number you are on will give you that number of points. Ex. Position 4 --> 4 points.
